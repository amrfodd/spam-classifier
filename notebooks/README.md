## Performance Evaluation

##### In this stage, we check out our performance evaluation by using confusion matrix. We used different metrics, such as precision, recall, f1 score and accuracy.



##### NB is giving the best results when applied for Nlp classification tasks. For this use-case, we care the most about the precision of the model, it is ok to flag some of the ham messages as spam. But it will be catastophic if we pass some spam messages as ham. Recall on the other hand is more important when we want to catch all the negative cases, such as diseases.
